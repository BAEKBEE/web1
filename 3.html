<h2>Python이란 무엇인가</h2>

 <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages </strong> and web applications.
<a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank" title="python official website">Python</a> is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its language constructs as well as its <strong>objected-oriented </strong> approach aim to help programmers write clear,
logical code for small and large-scale projects.<br><br>

Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.
Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.
Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting.
Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.
Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.</p>
Python consistently ranks as one of <u>the most popular</u>  programming languages
